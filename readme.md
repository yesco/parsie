# Parsie

A Minimalist Parser and code Generator with built-in interpeter.

## Generating

The output generated is by default all matched, but can be controlled by explicitly defining it per parse alternative:

   D=$d
   A=DA [$1*10+$2] |D

input:42 ==> 4*10+2

# possible names of the project

small parser+interpreter:

grokie - to grok a little -ie
  this might be better as it also implies understanding. As it can interpret generated code once the input program is parsed - it "groks", at least a little bit.

parsie - small parser?

parslet - a tiny parser

pars - forth like 4th letters, lol
